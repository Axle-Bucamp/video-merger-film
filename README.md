# 🎥 Video Merger with FILM (Google Research)  

This module merges two videos using **FILM (Frame Interpolation for Large Motion)** by Google Research.  
It aligns video transitions smoothly, ensuring high-quality, natural-looking interpolation.  

## 🛠 Features  
✅ **Video Resizing**: Ensures both videos have the same resolution before merging.  
✅ **FILM Frame Interpolation**: Uses Google's FILM model to generate smooth transitions.  
✅ **MP4 Output Support**: Saves the merged video in `.mp4` format.  
✅ **Seamless Merging**: Blends the last frame of the first video with the first frame of the second video.  

## 📦 Installation  

### 1️⃣ **Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/video-merger-film.git
cd video-merger-film
```

### 2️⃣ **Install Dependencies**  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> Ensure **OpenCV** and **FILM dependencies** are installed.  

### 3️⃣ **Download the FILM Model**  
```bash
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/film-model-path/film_model.pth -P models/
```

## 🚀 Usage  

### 🔹 **Merge Two Videos**  
```python
from video_merger import merge_videos

merge_videos("video1.mp4", "video2.mp4", "output.mp4", (1280, 720))
```

### 🔹 **Resize a Video**  
```python
from video_merger import resize_video

resize_video("input.mp4", "output_resized.mp4", (1280, 720))
```

## 🔧 How It Works  
1. **Resizes both videos** to match the target resolution.  
2. **Extracts the last frame of the first video & the first frame of the second video**.  
3. **Uses FILM** to generate smooth frame transitions.  
4. **Concatenates the videos** with seamless blending.  
5. **Saves the final output** as `merged_output.mp4`.  

## 📝 Requirements  
- Python 3.8+  
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)  
- FILM Model Weights  
- NumPy
